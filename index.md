# Welcome

Hi, I am glad you found my website. I am a researcher at Stanford's [SUNCAT](http://suncat.slac.stanford.edu/) Institute for Sustainable eNergy through CATalysis. I develop methods and tools to build better models for predicting the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts on an atomistic level. Please feel free to have a look around and help yourself if you find anything useful.
